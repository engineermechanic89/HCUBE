HCUBE - DIY 3dprinter 

The idea is to make a tinkering testbed that will be not too expensive to make, more accurate than chinese creations and very susceptible to modification.

Basic idea is to make a rather compact (350x350x350mm + overhangs, outside dimensions) Hbot printer that can be converted to CoreXY with change of 2 brackets, adding some idlers and second belt.

Z axis platform that can accommodate popular heatbeds like Mk2b or Creality Ender 3 heatbed, with 2 steppers and 4 linear shafts with possibility to change to two linear rails (with change of the shafts to two 20x20 vslot extrusions). Z height changed by different extrusions lenght + longer linear shafts and screws (that's why no linear rails are take into account at first).

Hotend mounting plate that can be used with DD (BMG+e3v v6 and clones) or bowden (Creality-like, Micro swiss etc.).

X and Y axis with 300mm linear rails.

Oriented more to accuracy and stability than high speeds.

Frame is designed that top and bottom plates, z platform, steppers and idlers brackets (except x axis beam) can be machined out of two 5x350x350mm Al alloy plates (except x axis beam and hotend plates) using waterjet, cnc router or similar, no bending.
